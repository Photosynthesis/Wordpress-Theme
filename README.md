# Fellowship of Intentional Communities Wordpress Theme

This is the wordpress theme used by FIC. It uses Webpack for asset compilation
& Bootstrap4 as a SASS Framework.

Right now this is mostly a port of our old Headway theme, but it will
eventually use Elm + REST & possibly be redesigned.

```
npm i
npm run build
npm run watch
```
